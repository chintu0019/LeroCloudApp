# LeroCloudApp

Only works when the cloud server is up and running.

Supports:
1. in-app fingerprint authentication as one of the authentication mechanism.
2. trusted physical boundaries are set to my home and my office ;)

To do:
1. add option for user set the trusted boundary.
2. add multiple authentication mechanisms. eg., web-sso, two-factor authentication.
3. cloud integration through API.
